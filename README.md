# Data Structures in Golang <sup><i>Fundamental Principles in Computer Science</i></sup>
In this repository, I'm going to implement text book principles we learned at university, for Data Structure. It was 
mostly done in Java, and C#. However, I will demonstrate the implementation in Golang. There may be some data structure 
that I might have not included here. I will do my best to research and create a proper jargon for Data Structures in Golang.
This could take time and more patience.

## Queue
 * FIFO (first-in-first-out)
 * Elements added at the back of queue


## Stack
 * LIFO (last-in-first-out)
 * Elements added at the top of the queue


## Graphs
tbc


## Map
 * Unordered
 * Pointer by default


## Array & Slice
 * Ordered
 * Dynamic size
 * Slice's element is a pointer to an Array


## Array
 * Ordered
 * Static size
 * Arrays are values by default (meaning passing a copy of variable in a function)
